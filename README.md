## About the project üìÅ

This project is about learning to use Express JS together with some other libraries such as bcrypt and jsonwebtoken on the way. 
The main idea was creating a Database which logs in users/admins and Super Admins to a Tattoo Studio Web Page. To be fully functional users can create appointments, change them, choose what kind of service they want and so on. The same goes for admins(the tattoo artists) and we have one super admin which is the owner of the database and can manage everything if needed.  
<br> More functionalities coming veeeery soon! :)

## ER Diagram from SQL üìä

- We have 4 entities in our Database created here. The strong among them is Roles (it can exist by itself), then we have Users which has many to one relation
  with roles. After this, we have Services which has One to many relation with our last entitiy (Appointments). Speaking of it - Appointments is the weekest of all
  entities, because it depends strongly on Users (because of the user_id) and Services(because of the service_id). More or less our database can be easily understood just by looking at the DDL schema posted here.

## Local installation option ‚öôÔ∏è

1. Clone the repository from the url
2. `$ npm install` (to get all the node packages)
3. Connect the cloned repo with our Database
4. `$ Execute the migrations`
5. `$ Execute the seeders`
6. `$ npm run dev` to run our server
7. ...
